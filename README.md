This application is designed to implement a Relational DBMS using the Java programming language.

The DBMS provides modules for user registration and login. Additionally, the system allows users to perform SQL operations on a text file, which acts as a table. 

There are a total of five Java files in this project: Main.java, Registration.java, Authentication.java, QueryCase.java, and Query.java. Each file is responsible for performing different operations within the system.
